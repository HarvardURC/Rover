This is the C++ EposDriveTrain class wrapped into a Python module (called DriveTrain).

To compile the module, execute the shell script autocompile.sh

NOTE: the libEpos library needs to be installed in the correct location for the module to be linked together correctly.
By default, the shell script tells g++ to look for libEpos in /usr/lib/
