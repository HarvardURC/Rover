# Rover
This is the clean version of Rover's 2018 code. We want to keep it this way.

## Rules

**Add documentation as you go**
Every commit should be named well, but far more importantly, add any functionality (and where to find it, and how to run it) in the documentation section below.

**Add any testing files to a `gitignore` unless they will be helpful for everyone else**
Ultimately, we want this repo to be as clean as any open sourced library, so let's only keep code that will actually be used this year in some form.

**Develop on the `dev` branch**
Obviously, we'll want to keep a development branch with tests, random stuff, etc.; keep this on the `dev` branch, and only merge actual functions into `master`. 

## Documentation

Soon to come! Let's get everything working first. I realize this is against rule 1; it will be fixed soon.
